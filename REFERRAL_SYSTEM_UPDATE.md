# Referral System Update - Migration from Event Scanning to Direct Contract Calls

## Problem Solved

The referral dashboard was experiencing timeout errors when trying to load referral and withdrawal history:

```
Failed to get block number, skipping chain: TimeoutError: The request took too long to respond.
URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545
```

This was caused by the old system trying to scan blockchain events using `getLogs()` with RPC endpoints that were timing out.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Hook: `useReferralData.js`

**Location:** `/src/hooks/useReferralData.js`

**Purpose:** Replace the old `useReferralEvents.js` hook that was scanning blockchain events.

**Key Features:**
- Uses direct contract calls via `useReadContract` instead of event scanning
- Calls `getReferrerInfo()` and `getWithdrawalHistory()` functions from the smart contract
- Processes data from both ETH and BNB chains
- No more RPC timeout issues

### 2. Updated Components

#### HistorySection.jsx
- **Changed:** Import from `useReferralEvents` to `useReferralData`
- **Added:** Informational note explaining the new data source
- **Result:** No more timeout errors

#### ReferralHistory.jsx
- **Enhanced:** Support for summary data format
- **Added:** Conditional rendering for transaction links
- **Improved:** Better handling of data when transaction hashes aren't available

#### WithdrawalHistory.jsx
- **Enhanced:** Conditional rendering for transaction links
- **Improved:** Better error handling for missing transaction data

### 3. Smart Contract Functions Used

The new system leverages these contract functions:

```solidity
// Get comprehensive referrer information
function getReferrerInfo(address _referrer) external view returns (
    uint256 totalReferrals,
    uint256 pendingCashback,
    uint256 bonusPercentage,
    uint256 nextWithdrawalTime,
    uint256 totalEarned,
    uint256 withdrawalCount
)

// Get withdrawal history from contract storage
function getWithdrawalHistory(address _user) external view returns (WithdrawalRecord[] memory)
```

## Benefits of the New System

### ✅ **Reliability**
- No more RPC timeout errors
- Direct contract calls are more reliable than event scanning
- Works consistently across different networks

### ✅ **Performance**
- Faster data loading
- No need to scan large block ranges
- Reduced network requests

### ✅ **Accuracy**
- Data comes directly from contract storage
- No risk of missing events due to RPC limitations
- Always up-to-date information

### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Simpler code structure
- Less dependency on external RPC providers
- Easier to debug and maintain

## Data Differences

### Old System (Event Scanning)
- ✅ Individual transaction details
- ✅ Transaction hashes for all entries
- ❌ RPC timeout issues
- ❌ Unreliable on some networks
- ❌ Complex block range management

### New System (Direct Contract Calls)
- ✅ Reliable data loading
- ✅ Summary statistics per chain
- ✅ Withdrawal history with amounts and timestamps
- ⚠️ Limited transaction hash availability
- ⚠️ Referral history shows summary data instead of individual purchases

## User Experience

### Referral History
- Shows summary data per chain (ETH/BNB)
- Displays total referrals and earnings
- Current bonus percentage
- Note: Individual purchase details not available from contract storage

### Withdrawal History
- Shows all withdrawal records with amounts and timestamps
- Displays withdrawal history from contract storage
- Transaction links available when data permits

### Information Note
Added a user-friendly note explaining the data source:

> "History data is retrieved directly from smart contract storage. Referral history shows summary data per chain, and withdrawal history shows amounts and timestamps. Individual transaction links may not be available for all entries."

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `/src/hooks/useReferralData.js` - New hook (created)
2. `/src/components/referral/HistorySection.jsx` - Updated import and added info note
3. `/src/components/referral/ReferralHistory.jsx` - Enhanced for summary data
4. `/src/components/referral/WithdrawalHistory.jsx` - Enhanced error handling
5. `/src/utils/referralManager.js` - Fixed `isAddress` undefined error
6. `/src/Rainbowkit.jsx` - Updated to use reliable RPC endpoints
7. `/src/utils/AggregatedPresaleService.js` - Updated BNB RPC endpoint

### Files Deprecated
- `/src/hooks/useReferralEvents.js` - No longer used (can be removed)

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed `isAddress` Undefined Error
**Problem:** Console error: `ReferenceError: isAddress is not defined`
**Location:** `/src/utils/referralManager.js` line 151
**Solution:** Changed `isAddress(address)` to `isValidAddress(address)` to use the local validation function

### Fixed BNB Testnet RPC Timeout Issues
**Problem:** BNB testnet RPC endpoint `https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545` was timing out
**Locations:** 
- `/src/Rainbowkit.jsx` - Wagmi configuration
- `/src/utils/AggregatedPresaleService.js` - Direct RPC calls
**Solution:** Updated to use reliable public RPC endpoints:
- BNB Testnet: `https://bsc-testnet-rpc.publicnode.com`
- ETH Sepolia: `https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com`

## Testing

The application has been:
- ✅ Built successfully without errors
- ✅ Deployed and running on port 12001
- ✅ Ready for testing with wallet connections

## Future Enhancements

If detailed transaction history is needed in the future, consider:

1. **Hybrid Approach:** Use contract calls for reliability + optional event scanning for details
2. **Backend Service:** Implement a backend service to index events and provide APIs
3. **Contract Enhancement:** Add more detailed storage to the smart contract

## Conclusion

The referral system has been successfully migrated from unreliable event scanning to reliable direct contract calls. Users will no longer experience timeout errors, and the system will provide consistent, accurate data from the smart contract storage.
