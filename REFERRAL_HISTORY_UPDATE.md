# Referral History System Update

## Overview
Updated the referral dashboard to display individual history cards for each referral and withdrawal instead of aggregated summary data.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useIndividualReferralData.js`
- **Location**: `/src/hooks/useIndividualReferralData.js`
- **Purpose**: Fetches individual `ReferralPurchase` and `ReferralWithdrawn` events from both ETH and BNB chains
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches up to 50 individual referral events per chain
  - Fetches up to 50 individual withdrawal events per chain
  - Uses blockchain event logs instead of contract storage for detailed transaction data
  - Includes transaction hashes for external link functionality
  - Handles both ETH (Sepolia) and BNB (Testnet) chains
  - Proper error handling and loading states

### 2. Updated Components

#### HistorySection.jsx
- **Change**: Switched from `useReferralData` to `useIndividualReferralData`
- **Impact**: Now receives individual event data instead of aggregated summaries

#### ReferralHistory.jsx
- **Changes**:
  - Removed summary card logic (`isSummary` checks)
  - Now displays individual referral cards for each purchase
  - Each card shows:
    - Buyer address (formatted)
    - Chain badge (ETH/BNB)
    - Purchase timestamp
    - USD amount of purchase
    - Bonus percentage earned
    - Cashback amount in native currency
    - Transaction hash link (if available)
  - Updated header text to show "Latest X referrals" instead of "entries"

#### WithdrawalHistory.jsx
- **Changes**:
  - Updated header text to show "Latest X withdrawals" instead of "entries"
  - Now uses event-based data for more accurate transaction information
  - Maintains existing individual withdrawal card functionality

### 3. Data Structure Changes

#### Before (Aggregated):
```javascript
// Single summary card per chain
{
  id: 'eth-referral-summary',
  chain: 'ETH',
  newReferralCount: 5, // Total referrals
  cashbackAmount: '0.1234', // Total earned
  isSummary: true
}
```

#### After (Individual):
```javascript
// Individual card per referral
{
  id: 'eth-0x123...abc-1',
  chain: 'ETH',
  buyer: '0x456...def',
  usdAmount: '100.00',
  nativeCurrencyPaid: '0.0345',
  cashbackAmount: '0.0034',
  bonusPercent: '10',
  timestamp: 1640995200000,
  transactionHash: '0x789...ghi',
  isSummary: false
}
```

## Technical Details

### Event Fetching Strategy
- **Block Range**: 
  - ETH (Sepolia): 5000 blocks
  - BNB (Testnet): 1000 blocks (due to stricter RPC limits)
- **Event Types**:
  - `ReferralPurchase`: Individual referral transactions
  - `ReferralWithdrawn`: Individual withdrawal transactions
- **Data Processing**: Events are sorted by timestamp (newest first) and limited to 50 entries per type

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when blockchain data is unavailable
- Individual error handling for each chain to prevent total failure
- Warning logs for debugging without breaking user experience

### Performance Considerations
- Limited to 50 entries per history type to prevent UI lag
- Efficient block range queries to minimize RPC calls
- Proper loading states during data fetching

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Individual Transaction Visibility**: Each referral and withdrawal now has its own card
2. **Detailed Information**: Shows buyer address, exact amounts, and timestamps
3. **Transaction Links**: Direct links to blockchain explorers for verification
4. **Better Organization**: Chronological listing of all activities

### For Developers
1. **Event-Based Data**: More accurate and detailed transaction information
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Can easily add more event types or chains
3. **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation between data fetching and UI components
4. **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive error logging and handling

## Usage

The referral dashboard will now automatically display:
- Individual cards for each referral (showing buyer, amount, bonus, etc.)
- Individual cards for each withdrawal (showing amount, timestamp, etc.)
- Up to 50 latest entries for each history type
- Real-time updates when new transactions occur

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pagination**: Add pagination for users with many transactions
2. **Filtering**: Add filters by chain, date range, or amount
3. **Export**: Add CSV export functionality for transaction history
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live transaction updates
5. **Enhanced Details**: Add more transaction metadata like gas fees, block confirmations

## Testing

To test the updated functionality:
1. Connect a wallet that has referral activity
2. Navigate to the Referral Dashboard
3. Verify that individual referral cards are displayed
4. Check that withdrawal history shows individual withdrawals
5. Test transaction hash links to blockchain explorers
6. Verify loading states and error handling

## Deployment Notes

- The changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- Existing user data remains accessible
- Performance impact is minimal due to efficient querying
